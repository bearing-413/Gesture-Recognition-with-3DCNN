I select 6 different gestures from jester dataset   
Include swiping left, swiping right, no gesture, rolling forward, rolling backward, stop

First model:LRN+HRN can reach 0.78 accuracies

Second model: 3DCNN can reach 0.76 accuracies

Third model: 3DCNN+ one layer LSTM / + two layer LSTM / + three layer LSTM

## You can directly type in follwing command on your terminal
```bash
python real_time/real_time.py
```
